## Project Title

**Token-backed Peer-to-Peer Tutoring**

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a decentralized peer-to-peer tutoring platform using Ethereum smart contracts. It allows tutors and students to connect, exchange educational services, and make payments in a seamless manner using tokens. Students can register, fund their balance, start tutoring sessions, and pay tutors based on an hourly rate. The platform ensures secure, transparent transactions and allows tutors to offer services based on availability.

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to create a transparent, efficient, and decentralized educational ecosystem. The platform eliminates intermediaries, ensuring that tutors receive the full payment for their services and students get value for their money. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system offers transparency in payments and prevents fraudulent activities. Our long-term goal is to build a global tutoring community where anyone can offer or receive tutoring services securely.

## Future Scope

- **Global Expansion**: With the success of the smart contract, the platform can be scaled to different regions globally.
- **Multilingual Support**: Adding multilingual support to cater to a diverse group of users.
- **Token Integration**: Introduce a native token for internal transactions and incentives.
- **Additional Features**: Features such as reviews, session ratings, and advanced dispute resolution mechanisms can be added.
- **Mobile Application**: Create a mobile application for both students and tutors to easily interact with the platform.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Registration**: Both tutors and students can register directly on the blockchain.
- **Token-backed Payments**: Tutors are paid in tokens for their time spent tutoring.
- **Availability Tracking**: Tutors can set their availability, ensuring students can only book when the tutor is available.
- **Transparent Transactions**: Every session and payment is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full transparency.
- **Easy Funding**: Students can fund their accounts with tokens, simplifying the payment process for tutoring services.
- **Session Management**: Tutors and students can start and end sessions, ensuring proper tracking and payment for services rendered.
